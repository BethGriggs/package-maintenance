  * First meeting Thursday 13th February 2020 5PM UTC to clarify use cases.

*Extracted from **package-maintenance-agenda** labelled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/package-maintenance

* 2FA in CI [#282](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/pull/282)
  * Productive RFC call.
  * Follow up with notes and use cases.
  * Some technical details to be addressed
* Document the current 'top 10' express' issues [#233](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/233)
  * Status board issue where indexing was timing out.
  * Seeking volunteers to do the work.
* Next steps on Support levels in Package.json [#192](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/192)
  * A CLI help generate the support metadata, potentially as part of pkgjs
  * Requires evangelism and a blog post.
    * Michael would know the correct contact at the foundation to publish the blog.
    * Call for a volunteer to write the blog post.
  * Darcy reached out to the owner of `create-pkg` on `npm`.
    * One week or so before we can go through the support channel to adopt that module name.
  * Work/prototyping could progress under the pkgjs organisation in the meantime.
  * Suggestion of composable generators, including a specific generator for support metadata.

## Project Board Review (maybe, if time permits).

Ask participants about the state of [Project Board](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/projects/1) and necessary changes if time permits.

## Q&A, Other

* Consider pkgjs contributing guidelines [#271](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/271)
  * PR approval process?, How do we enforce CoC?, etc.
  * pkgjs is a dedicated org for us to experiment/create prototypes without being under the `nodejs/` banner.
  * Node.js organisation may imply too strong affiliation and/or stability.
  * This issue potentially applies to other teams/projects under the foundation.
    * TSC issue to discuss how to spin off external organisations.
    * Will run by Michael Dawson as he is likely to know the correct place to raise.
* Yarn has an end-to-end automation project which may relate to our discussions around CITGM.
